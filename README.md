# Hi Everyone!

I'm a hardware enthusiast currently enrolled in the Computer Repair and Maintenance program at Centennial College. 🪛🖥️

I'm currently working on launching my own Apache web server (with the help and guidance of my professor) using an Ubuntu instance with Amazon Web Services. 🔧🌐

Hardware is my central focus, but I recognize the importance for a technician to have a diverse set of skills and tools, and to have knowledge of networking and software applications. 🔨🧰

I'm looking forward to learning more from the GitHub community and progressing in my journey! 👨‍💻👨‍🔧
